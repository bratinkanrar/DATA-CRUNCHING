# DATA-CRUNCHING

# APPROACHING
1.Import pandas library
2.Then read  tsv files and merge them using pd.merge() function by setting the ‘on’ parameter to the common column present in both files. Then store the result in a new dataframe called ‘Output_df’.
3.Store remaining files in a list.
4.Run a loop that will iterate over these file names. Read these files one by one and merge them with ‘Output_df’  dataframe
5.Save ‘Output_df’ in tsv file
